# Pico RACK - <ins>R</ins>etro <ins>A</ins>dapter for <ins>C</ins>omputer <ins>K</ins>eyboards
A PCB designed to work with the ps2x2pico project which simplifies the hardware setup and provides for multiple target computer keyboard interfaces at the same time.

Concept: This adapter would connect to a Raspberry Pi Pico running the code from the [ps2x2pico project](https://github.com/No0ne/ps2x2pico). It would allow the user to connect a USB keyboard to a vintage computer and switch between PS/2 (AT), XT, Early Mac, and ADB keyboard interfaces.

Status: The schematic for this project and the changes necessary to support it are still in the early phases.
